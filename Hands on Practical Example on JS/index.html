        This is a normal paragraph (p element). To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the effect of user style sheets.<br /> You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements by default.<br />It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.<br />

        This is a div element. Authors may use such elements instead of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of div.)
